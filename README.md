# Blinkit_Grocery_Data_Analysis 📊
This project is an end-to-end sales analysis and interactive dashboard for Blinkit, an Indian quick-commerce grocery app owned by Zomato. The goal is to analyze sales performance, product categories, outlet characteristics, and customer ratings using Microsoft Excel.

# Business Problem 🔍
Blinkit wants to understand how different products, outlet types, locations, and outlet sizes contribute to overall revenue and customer satisfaction, so that it can optimize product mix, outlet strategy, and marketing efforts. This project answers questions such as:​

◻️Which product categories generate the most sales?                                                                                                  
◻️How do sales differ by outlet size, location tier, and outlet type?                                                              
◻️What is the overall customer rating and how does it vary across items and outlets?
